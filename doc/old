@chapter About LUK

LUK is a lean microkernel whose primary purpose is to teach the
principles of microkernels.  It runs on x86_32 PC hardware and
boots from a USB memory stick.  When it boots it is the sole
system, there is no linux, windows or whatever.

LUK is written in C, Modula-2 and assembly language.  All the lab
exercises are available in C and (or Modula-2) students can study the
microkernel in either language if desired.  Students do not need to
be familiar with Modula-2 in order to complete the C lab exercises.

LUK runs in 32 bit protected mode and can create an arbitary number
of lightweight processes using the @code{Executive} module.
It has @code{Timerhandler} module for creating time related events
a keyboard and screen device driver.  There is also a very primative
text based window device.

LUK coordinates interrupts and processes via semaphores implemented in
the @code{Executive}.  It currently uses a simple round robin
scheduler to allocate processor time to the runnable processes.

@chapter Obtaining LUK

You can download a copy LUK from
@uref{http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/download/luk/luk-@value{version-luk}.tar.gz}
and then you need to extract the archive using the following command
line:

@example
$ tar xvf luk-@value{version-luk}.tar.gz
@end example

@node Building dependencies, , (dir) (dir)

LUK requires the following packages to be installed.

The GNU C compiler @file{gcc}, GNU Modula-2 @file{gm2}, GNU make
@file{make}, GNU binutils @file{binutils}, @file{m2f} and Bruce Evan's
assembler (@file{bin86}.

Assuming that you are on a Debian or Ubuntu based system you could
obtain @file{gm2} and @file{m2f} by adding these entries to
your @file{/etc/apt/sources.list}.

@example
#
#  GNU Modula-2 repo
#

deb http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/debian/ squeeze main 
deb-src http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/debian/ squeeze main
@end example

Now there can be installed by the following commands:

@example
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install bin86 libc6-dev-i386 gm2 gcc m2f
@end example

@node Building LUK, , (dir), (dir)

You can build LUK by:

@example
$ mkdir -p build $HOME/opt
$ cd build
$ ../luk-@value{version-luk}/configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
$ make
$ cd ..
@end example
