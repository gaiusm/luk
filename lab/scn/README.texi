@section scn

In this exercise you should complete the screen device driver Scn.c.

There is an initial attempt of @code{Scn.c} in this directory and this
can be built using the generic building instructions found in this
document.  You need to complete the function @code{ScrollUp} which
should move each line up the screen and then finally blank the bottom
line.

The screen can be accessed via the pointer to array
@code{(*screen)[j][i]}.  The screen top row is accessed via
@code{(*screen)[0][i]}.  Where @code{i} can have any value
@code{0..Width-1} which represents the columns (left to right).
