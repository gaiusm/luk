@section hello

In this directory is a simple application which just prints ``hello world''
to the screen and terminates.  It is a minimal application which tests
whether the microkernel can build and boot correctly.  This example is
complete and does not require any source code changes.

You need to modify the @file{Makefile.in} and set the @code{APPLICATION}
variable to @code{hello}.  So the top of @file{Makefile.in} should look
like this:

@example
#
# ================
# Makefile for luk
# ================
#
# You can configure the microkernel building in the following
# lines of code
# 
# uncomment _one_ of the following APPLICATIONs to build an
# appropriate microkernel
#
#
APPLICATION=hello
# APPLICATION=debug
# APPLICATION=scn
# APPLICATION=boundedbuffer
etc etc
@end example
