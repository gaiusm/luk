@section boundedbuffer

In this exercise you must complete the bounded buffer module as discussed
in the lecture.

There is an initial attempt of BufferDevice.c in this directory and
this can be built using the generic building instructions found in
this document.  Your task is to finish the two functions
@code{BufferDevice_InitBuffer} and @code{BufferDevice_ReadBuffer}.
Both functions have been discussed in the lectures and their
associated notes.
