@section debug

In this exercise you should implement the function DebugString inside
the file @file{Debug.c}.  Notice that there are two parameters to
DebugString the pointer to the start of the string and the maximum
number of characters which maybe in the string.

All characters from the pointer up until the @code{<nul>} character
@code{(char)0} should be emitted.  No more than the maximum number of
characters should be emitted, in case there is no trailing
@code{(char)0}.

There is an initial attempt of @code{Debug.c} in this directory and
this can be built using the generic building instructions found in
this document.

Your function @code{DebugString} must check for the character sequence
'\' 'n' and this should be cause a newline to be printed.  Hint you
should call @code{WriteLn}.
