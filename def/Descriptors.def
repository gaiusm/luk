    Description: provides an interface to some assembly language
                 which sets up the 386/486 gdt and idt.
                 This does the minumum necessary to allow the 386/486
                 to access 1Gb

   SetupGDT - sets up a global descriptor for the whole of physical
              memory. It maps 16 Mb of physical memory.
              It does not touch any extended memory - you must be
              careful not to touch any physical memory that isn't
              really there.
