    Description: this module is implemented in 16 bit x86
                 and as such it is incompatible with the main
                 LuK 32 bit code.  It provides support routines
                 for the boot.S bootsector and second.mod secondary
                 boot stage.  It is minimal as the first boot stage
                 must not exceed 512 bytes in total.
